The Bitwise Utility Tool is a menu-driven mini project implemented in the C programming language to demonstrate the practical application of bitwise operators and control flow mechanisms. Bitwise operations perform direct manipulation of data at the binary (bit) level, which is fundamental to low-level programming and system-oriented applications.

In this project, the program accepts two integer inputs from the user and provides a menu-based interface to select a specific bitwise operation. The selection is processed using a switch-case control structure, ensuring efficient and structured execution. Based on the user’s choice, the corresponding bitwise operator—AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), Left Shift (<<), or Right Shift (>>)—is applied, and the computed result is displayed.

The implementation utilizes core concepts of C programming such as standard input/output functions, switch-case statements, arithmetic and bitwise operators, and variable manipulation. Left and right shift operations are used to demonstrate bit-level data shifting, which directly corresponds to multiplication or division by powers of two at the binary level.

This mini project is developed to strengthen the understanding of bit-level data processing, enhance logical thinking, and reinforce foundational programming skills. It also provides insight into how bitwise operations are used in areas such as memory management, embedded systems, performance optimization, and low-level components of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems.

Overall, the Bitwise Utility Tool serves as an effective learning-oriented project that bridges theoretical knowledge of bitwise operations with practical implementation using the C programming language.
